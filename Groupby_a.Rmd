plants <- clean_data %>%

#time to see if there is a difference in the counts of native bees due to the presence of non-native bees

```

```{r}
#creating boxplot 

ggplot(plants, aes(x = non_nativebee_present, y = nativebee_count))+
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightgreen", alpha = 0.6) +

        y = "Native bee abundance",

```
This is the opposite of our predictions. However one can observe a much larger range in native bee abundances for when non native bees are present. FALSE(n=51), TRUE(n=73)
