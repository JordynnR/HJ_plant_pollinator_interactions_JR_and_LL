Introduction:
  Invasive species are known to have a negative impact on native species and ecosystems around the world. Non-native plant invasions contribute to dwindling populations of native plant species that are ecologically and culturally important. Similarly, non-native pollinators can outcompete native species and contribute to population decline. This can further affect native plants that rely on native pollinators for efficient pollination if invasive species don’t replace the same functions. However, the specific effects invasions can have on plant-pollinator interactions can vary. A review paper by @Traveset_2006 explains that invasive pollinators can have little to no impact on highly specialized native plant-pollinator mutualisms because invasive pollinators tend to be generalists and will interact with a wider variety of plant species. Invasive plants can have more of an impact on these native mutualisms, especially if they are more attractive to native pollinators and outcompete native plants. A study by @Morales_2009  found that native or ‘alien’ species can negatively impact pollinator visitation rates and reproduction of native co-flowering focal species, which may contribute to their ability to dominate landscapes and alter plant community and structure. Invasive pollinators and plants may even interact with each other to have a greater impact on native plant-pollinator communities. For example, @Barthell_2001 investigated the interactions between an invasive bee, Apis mellifera, and an invasive plant, Centaurea solstitialis, and found that A. mellifera increases the reproductive success of C. solstitialis, suggesting that invasive plant-pollinator mutualisms could contribute to more successful plant invasions, further impacting native plant-pollinator interactions.
  With all of these variable effects, it is important to understand native plant-pollinator interactions locally in order to better predict how invasions may impact the community in a certain place. More specific place-based studies have investigated how invasive pollinators can impact native plant-pollinator communities, primarily due to competition with native pollinators. For example, @Dohzono_2008 found that a Japanese native bumblebee Bombus ardens visited a native plant, Corydalis ambigua, much less frequently when the invasive Bombus terrestris visited. This resulted in lower reproduction for the plant because B. terrestris robs nectar without contributing to pollination. Most of the research on invasive pollinators centers on the very successful Apis mellifera, or European honeybee, which has been brought all over the world to live alongside agricultural fields in order to pollinate crops and make honey. But their introduction into any ecosystem can have an impact on native bees and plants. For example, when @Thomson_2004 studied the interactions between a California native social bee, B. occidentalis, and A. mellifera, they found that B. occidentalis colonies located closer to A. mellifera hives had lower reproductive success, which could have a further impact on plant species that rely on this native bee. Another study by @Dupont_2004 focusing on the impact of A. mellifera found that these pollinators can disrupt native pollination networks by altering native bee foraging behaviours and increasing competition for nectar in flowering populations. Similarly in a meta-analysis paper, @Morales_2009 monitored visitation rate and reproductive success of native plant species located next to alien plant species. The paper proposed that the two most important properties of alien plant competition are floral abundance and the similarity of floral morphologies with native plants. The latter in particular can encourage native bees to pollinate non-natives, while specialist native plants are out-competed.  
  However, not all research has found a negative impact of invasive species on native plant-pollinator networks. In a study by @Borchardt_2025 on plant-pollinator interactions in prairie strips alongside agricultural fields in California, they found little to no impact of A. mellifera presence on native bee community composition from June to August. Similarly, @Spessa_1999 studied the impact of honeybee presence on a native colletid bee Amphylaeus morosus and detected no negative impact, concluding that nectar and pollen were not limiting for A. morosus and the null hypothesis was accepted, even though there was a resource overlap between the two study species. With the variable results from different studies, it stands to reason that different species of pollinator will be limited by different factors @Paini_2004.
  Most of the research into how invasive species, especially pollinators like A. mellifera, impact native plant-pollinator interactions are situated close to more human-altered landscapes, such as agricultural areas. There is less research into native plant-pollinator interactions and how invasive species alter them in more remote areas. In our research, we investigate native plant-pollinator associations in high-elevation meadows, which are further from dense human populations. There may not be as much of an invasive bee impact here, especially due to the lack of commercial beekeeping. We use plant-pollinator network data from the HJ Andrews experimental forest in order to explore these interactions. This data was collected in high-elevation meadows in the HJ Andrews experimental forest. It includes pollinator observations at different plant focals and data on focal plant and pollinator taxonomy, date of observation, site and plot of observation, and much more. We primarily use the identification of plants and pollinators and the date of observations. We also use plant databases, such as Oregon Flora and Calflora in order to identify which plants in the data are native or non-native. We have a list of the most common non-native bee species present in the research site. We assume all other bee species are native.
  We aim to use this data to explore 3 main questions: (1) What plants do native bees more strongly associate with in high-elevation meadows in Oregon? Are they more often native or non-native? (2) Do non-native bees compete with native bees for access to native plants in these meadows? and (3) How do the interactions between native bees and their preferred plants change over the growing season in high-elevation meadows? We first predict that native bees will more strongly associate with native plants in high-elevation meadows in Oregon. This is because native bees and plants have coexisted for longer and may have coevolved to be more specialized, especially in montane regions which have forced them to adapt to harsher conditions compared with other ecoregions. We also predict that there will be little to no significant change in native plant-pollinator relationships in the presence of non-native bees due to a low presence of non-native bees. We expect a lower presence of non-native bees because the montane study region may have environmental constraints that lead to native species easily out-competing non-native species that aren’t so well adapted and haven’t historically been introduced here like A. mellifera has in agricultural areas. Finally, we predict that native bees may shift to stronger associations with non-native plants later in the growing season due to potentially later blooming non-native species, while native species may bloom earlier.
  Our findings will provide insight into how invasive plants impact interactions between native plants and bees in high elevation meadows, whether there is interspecific competition for native plant resources between native and non-native bees in this ecosystem, and how these dynamics may be amplified or dampened over phenological time. The study of these interactions in this region is important because wilder areas have been understudied compared to urban and agricultural areas and plant-pollinator networks have been shown to react to invasion differently depending on the species and location. We need to better understand these interactions to track how potential future disturbances, such as invasions, may affect the structure of these communities.
