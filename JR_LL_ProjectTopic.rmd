General topic: plant-pollinator interactions, with respect to native and non-native species, in high-elevation meadows

Questions:
What plants do native bees more strongly associate with in high-elevation meadows in Oregon? Are they more often native or non-native?
Do non-native bees compete with native bees for access to native plants in these meadows?
How do the interactions between native bees and their preferred plants change over the growing season in high-elevation meadows?

Dataset: We are using the HJ Andrews dataset that records species interactions between plants and pollinators in high elevation meadows.
