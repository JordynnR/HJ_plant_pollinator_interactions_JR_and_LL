need this???
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Questions about dataset:
1. what does each row mean?- a single observation of a bee interacting with a plant?
2. how to transform date column into month as well (maybe day?- probably not)
3. network- do we need to choose/keep one of the columns in the spreadsheet of the interaction strength values?


columns to keep:
Year
Site??
Genus??
GenusSpecies
PlantGenus
PlantGenusSpecies
Date

```{r}
##need to read data in and start cleaning it up- 
# 1- get rid of unnecessary columns
# 2- figure out what species to keep
raw_data<- read.csv("raw_data/spec_net_copy.csv")

```

##get rid of columns
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
kept_columns<- raw_data %>%
  select(Year, Date, Genus, GenusSpecies, PlantGenusSpecies)

unique(kept_columns$GenusSpecies)
```
