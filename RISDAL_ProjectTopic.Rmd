General topic: plant-pollinator interactions, with respect to native and non-native species

Questions:
Do native bees more often visit native or non-native plants?
Do non-native bees more often visit native or non-native plants?
Does this relationship change over the months and/or over the years?

Other datasets: We can use PRISM climate data for Oregon if we need to https://prism.oregonstate.edu/
