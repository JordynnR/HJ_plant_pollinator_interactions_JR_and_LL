Workflow-    how we’ll implement it
Step 1: Convert to csv and read in

Step 2: Clean data
a. Get rid of unneeded columns- Temp stuff, wind stuff, , unique ID??, collector, order, family, subgenus, determiner, author, 
b. Get rid of rows that have empty plant or bee genus species (or not, maybe genus enough for some bees?)

Step 3: add column for native or non-native for both bees and plants

Step 4: start analysis
A. Group by site and abundances of native/non-natives for plants and bees
Determine if there is a difference between sites- how???

B. Group all native and non-native bees to see if there is a difference in abundance overall
If little non-native abundance, may not have question 2 answered or may not be significant
If yes- separate by plants with non-native presence and see if less native bee abundance to see if competition for native plants exists here

c. AB test: Test statistic at both native and non-native plants (A and B groups) to see if there is a significant difference in native bee association with native vs non plants

D. Sankey interaction network- all plants and bees??- see strongest interactions
Group native plants and non-native plants and native bees and non-native bees and see interactions/interaction quantity b/w groups

E. Create boxplots of non-native vs native plant abundances by month
Two separate graphs

F. AB tests?? Grouped sankey networks?? Over time



Also need functions/loops:


Unit tests:
need to have unit tests to test that functions work
unique(table$column)- check for the right number of categories in column after filtering



Expected Visualizations:
Questions 1 & 2: 
Sankey for network visual??- compare quantity of native bee interactions with natives vs non-natives overall
Compare native-native to non-native bee to native interactions

Compare abundances of native to non-native bees?? Is there a significant non-native bee presence
Is there a difference between sites?


Question 3: 
box plots of non-native plant abundances over time, 
(associations of native bees with non-natives over time, and with native plants over time)
How to visualize associations??? Just interaction networks??- some sort of quantifying?? Can we quantify from interaction networks
